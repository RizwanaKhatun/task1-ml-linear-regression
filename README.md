# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow using a Linear Regression model
to predict house prices based on the California Housing dataset.

## 📊 Dataset
- California Housing Dataset (from scikit-learn)
- Features include median income, house age, population, and location-based variables.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Workflow
1. Data loading and exploration (EDA)
2. Data visualization and correlation analysis
3. Train-test split
4. Model training using Linear Regression
5. Model evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and R² score
6. Visualization of predictions and residuals

## 📈 Results
- The model achieved reasonable performance in predicting house prices.
- Evaluation metrics include MAE, RMSE, and R² Score.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Try Ridge and Lasso regression
- Feature scaling
- Experiment with non-linear models
